                                </p>

                                    Society of Anesthesiology and the 14th Annual Meeting of the Federation of Asian
                                    Dental Anesthesia Society (FADAS) will be held concurrently　at the Nagasaki
                                    International Exhibition Hall (Dejima Messe Nagasaki) from Friday, October 6 to
                                    Sunday, October 8, 2023.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Japanese Dental Society of Anesthesiology celebrated the 50th anniversary
                                    of its establishment in 2022. The society aims to fulfill the needs and
                                    expectations of the public in the next half a century. We take our
                                    responsibility of nurturing specialists who can assist sincerely in the safe,
                                    secure, trusted, and comfortable delivery of dental care to patients. In today's
                                    multidisciplinary healthcare environment, dental anesthesiologists must
                                    collaborate with fellow medical colleagues and other health staff members. To
                                    achieve our purposes, we need to prioritize and ensure medical safety and
                                    quality assurance. We must also develop the next generation of advanced medical
                                    care. Furthermore, we must take on bold challenges by promoting relevant
                                    clinical research, medical-industrial collaborations, and AI applications.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the first time, the annual meeting of the FADAS will be held in Nagasaki.
                                    Historically, Nagasaki held close cultural ties with China, Taiwan, and
                                    Southeast Asia. More recently, the city has continued to build close economic
                                    ties with these countries. As we are overcoming the coronavirus pandemic, it is
                                    a timely opportunity to invite overseas clinicians and researchers who share the
                                    same aspirations to present and discuss the latest medical research and ideas.
                                    This will also provide a valuable opportunity to discuss how we can promote
                                    future international collaborations, and convey <span style="font-weight: bold;">"empathy and trust"</span> to all
                                    patients, and medical and other healthcare professionals worldwide.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With the operation of the new Shinkansen bullet train line in 2022, a new
                                    chapter will begin for Nagasaki. As the first city to introduce Western medicine
                                    to Japan, it seems most appropriate that we meet in Nagasaki to discuss the
                                    future direction of dental anesthesiology. It will be most exciting to meet
                                    together face to face after a long time. To meet the expectations of our
                                    members, we are working together with members of the Scientific Meeting
                                    Organizing Committee to ensure that the meeting is creative and innovative. The
                                    spread of the new coronavirus infection, partly due to the effects of mutant
                                    strains, continues to impact societies and economies around the world. The Tokyo
                                    Summer Olympics and Paralympics in 2020 and the Beijing Winter Olympics and
                                    Paralympics in 2021 were successfully held without any spectators, and left a
                                    great impression in the memory of many due to the efforts of all concerned.
                                    These events also highlighted the importance and value of meeting face-to-face,
                                    and the exhilarating feeling that comes with physical interactions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Japanese Dental Society of Anesthesiology also confirmed, based on the
                                    experience of holding the meeting online for two years, that it is possible to
                                    effectively exchange academic opinions via the Internet. The advantages of
                                    virtual meetings are that many participants can come together to attend various
                                    committees and meetings without traveling, and therefore, are cost-effective and
                                    time-saving. Importantly, we have learned how efficient on-demand presentations
                                    are for medical and healthcare professionals who wish to study the latest
                                    medical knowledge and techniques but are unable to meet at a specific time and
                                    place due to other commitments such as parenting responsibilities. Virtual
                                    meetings are also helpful to young researchers who may not have exuberant funds
                                    to spend on travel and accommodation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We are looking forward to the 2023 Annual Meeting. It will be the first time the
                                    meeting is held in Nagasaki in the last 25 years. We are excited that we can
                                    meet face-to-face and interact as much as we want, after a long absence. We hope
                                    that you will attend this meeting and take home with you the latest medical
                                    knowledge and techniques, also enjoy the energetic atmosphere as well. It will
                                    be a great meeting that affirms the responsibility and pride of dental
                                    anesthesiologists who will lead the next generation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Please make the time to attend this purposeful meeting. We would be honored by
                                    your presence.
                                </p>
